I'm learning how VoWifi/VoLTE works by trying three experiments:

- Connecting to VoWifi using fasferraz's Python IKEv2/EAP-AKA implementation: failed
- Connecting to VoLTE using Linphone: failed
- Capturing IMSIs with a Wi-Fi hotspot, a fake DNS server, and a VPN server: succeeded

# Introduction and glossary

VoLTE and VoWifi may seem [complicated](https://twitter.com/the6p4c/status/1299982755149656065), but to make a phone call, you phone actually just talks to two computers:

![diagram of VoLTE/VoWifi](/assets/blog/vowifi/ims_diagram.png)

As documented in the excellent presentations by ERNW ([first](https://ernw.de/download/telco/ERNW_Area41_IMSecure.pdf), [second](https://deepsec.net/docs/Slides/2017/How_secure_are_your_VoLTE_and_VoWiFi_Calls_Sreepriya_Chalakkal.pdf)), VoLTE and VoWifi are based on common technologies:

- In VoLTE, the phone connects via SIP to the **P-CSCF**, which is the carrier's SIP VoIP server.
- In VoWifi, the phone first makes a IPSec VPN connection to the **ePDG**, the carrier's VPN server for VoWifi. Then it connects over the VPN to the P-CSCF SIP server, like VoLTE.

However, VoLTE's implementation is not compatible with our everyday VPNs and VoIP software. [This report from Sysmocom](https://www.jeroenbaten.nl/UT-VoLTE-proposed-technical-architecture.pdf) shows that it would take months to modify Ubuntu Touch for VoLTE support.

So what stops me from connecting to the VoWifi VPN server with regular VPN software, or the VoLTE SIP server with regular VoIP software? I decided to find out.

Experiments conducted on Ubuntu 21.04 in a VMWare Fusion VM, connected to a Pixel 3 XL running Android 11 on Mint (a T-Mobile MVNO).

# Connecting to VoWifi

To connect to the special VoWifi VPN, I used [fasferraz's **SWu-IKEv2**](https://github.com/sysmocom/SWu-IKEv2), an IKEv2/IPSec VPN client which implements the special **EAP-AKA'** authentication method that uses a SIM card.

In [EAP-AKA'](https://realtimecommunication.wordpress.com/2016/04/06/epdg-and-ipsec/):

- Only the carrier and the SIM card itself knows a secret key, `K`
- When authenticating, the carrier sends two values: an `AUTN` value and a `RAND` value
- The `AUTN` value proves to the SIM card that it's the real carrier
- The SIM card encrypts the `RAND` value with the secret K key to derive two secret keys: `IK`, `CK`; and a response value, `RES`
- It sends the `RES` value back to the carrier to prove that it's the real SIM card
- The phone starts encrypting the connection with `IK` and `CK`
- The carrier does the same encryption with the `K` key to obtain the expected `IK`, `CK`, and `RES` values
- The carrier compares the `RES` value before decrypting the connection with `IK` and `CK`
- Since nobody else has the `K` key, they can't eavesdrop or pretend to be the user/carrier

In summary, I need to send `AUTN` and `RAND` to the SIM card, and get `RES`, `IK`, and `CK` back.

SWu-IKEv2 supports talking to a real SIM card for EAP-AKA', defining an [HTTP API](https://github.com/fasferraz/USIM-https-server) to communicate with a SIM card reader.

I decided to implement that API as an Android app so I can use the SIM card in my phone:

- Android has a public API, [`TelephonyManager.getIccAuthentication`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getIccAuthentication(int,%20int,%20java.lang.String)) to run this authentication flow
- Added for [Android's Wi-Fi](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/master:packages/modules/Wifi/service/java/com/android/server/wifi/WifiCarrierInfoManager.java;l=1323;drc=4367f1ec9fa7f060f942c0bf1b4b9c978b578e4f) framework, since there are Wi-Fi hotspots that use the SIM card to [authenticate](https://twitter.com/zhuowei/status/1459668374502481924)
- Also available [from ADB](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/+/android-11.0.0_r48:frameworks/base/packages/Shell/AndroidManifest.xml;l=33;drc=907c235865ef3e8f6113db419d268e62a16d497f) on Android 10 and above
- (Not available on Android 8.1. I tried [using other SIM card APIs](https://github.com/zhuowei/SimServerAndroid/tree/failed-apdu-auth) to try to get this value, but it blocked me every time)

I built a [an HTTP server Android app](https://github.com/zhuowei/SimServerAndroid) that generates SIM authentication requests:

```
adb shell sh /sdcard/runsimserver.sh serve 3333
```

(My app uses http instead of https, because I'm not dealing with certificates. Thankfully it was easy to patch SWu-IKEv2 to support plain http.)

(Protip: if something fails, `adb logcat -b radio` often gives the modem's error message)

I searched online for the [ePDG address for T-Mobile](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/pq3rxi/which_epdg_for_wifi_calling/), set the APN to `ims`, pointed SWu-IKEv2's SIM reader address to my phone, and tried connecting:

```
# python3 swu_emulator.py -m "http://192.168.1.9:3333" -d "ss.epdg.epc.mnc260.mcc310.pub.3gppnetwork.org" -M 310 -N 260 -a "ims"
<snip>
STATE 3:
-------
sending IKE_SA_AUTH (2)
received decoded message:
[[46, [[41, [0, 24, b'', b'']]]]]
received IKE_AUTH (2)
OTHER_ERROR : 24
```

It gets most of the handshake, including the SIM card credentials, but it returns an error on `IKE_SA_AUTH`. 

Maybe it's because Mint Mobile requires me to register an emergency address before I could turn on Wi-Fi calling, or perhaps SWu-IKEv2 doesn't implement a handshake compatible with T-Mobile/Mint.

(In fact, when I tried Verizon's Wi-Fi calling server, SWu-IKEv2 isn't even able to get through the first part of the handshake, and never reaches the SIM card auth. I tried StrongSwan instead, but couldn't figure out the config file.)

# Connecting to VoLTE

If I can't connect to the VoWifi VPN, can I connect to the VoLTE SIP server directly?

On Android, I can find the SIP server address using `dumpsys`:

```
$ dumpsys telephony.registry
<snip>
PcscfAddresses: [ /fd00:1234:5678:1234::1,/fd00:1234:1:123::1,/fd00:1234:5678:1234::2 ]
```

It's a private (`fd00::`) IP address, so cannot be accessed over Internet, but I can access it over Wi-Fi tethering from my phone.

I first tried [`sipp`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/sip-tester), a SIP tester, to see if it can make any SIP connection:

```
$ sipp -sn uac fd00:1234:1:123::1 -m 1 -auth_uri "sip:310260111111111@ims.mnc260.mcc310.3gppnetwork.org"

'
```

Since it got a SIP response, I decided to try Linphone to see if that works better.

```
echo "register sip:310260111111111@ims.mnc260.mcc310.3gppnetwork.org [fd00:1234:5678:1234::1]" | linphone-daemon --config ./lollinphonerc 
daemon-linphone>Status: Ok

```

Looking at the log, it seems to fail with an `Extension Required` message:

```

After looking up what extensions [a real SIP client](http://hongjoo71-e.blogspot.com/2015/07/e2e-volte-call-setup24-ims-registration.html) has, I tried adding this line to the Linphone config.

```
[sip]
supported=replaces, outbound, gruu, sec-agree
```

This sets `Supported: replaces, outbound, gruu, sec-agree` in the header, but I got the exact same `Extension Required` error.

# A fake VoWifi ePDG

OK, so connecting to a carrier is impossible.

Thankfully, pretending to be a carrier to grab IMSIs [is easy](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/eu-16/materials/eu-16-OHanlon-WiFi-IMSI-Catcher.pdf), and there are [guides on how to do it](https://wgtwo.com/vowifi-leaking-imsi/).

To pretend to be a ePDG Wi-Fi calling VPN, I created a StrongSwan VPN config:

```
config setup
    charondebug="ike 4"
conn ikev2-vpn
    auto=add
    type=tunnel
    keyexchange=ikev2
    left=%any
    leftid=@ims
    right=%any
    rightid=%any
    rightauth=eap-aka
    rightsourceip=10.10.10.0/24
    rightdns=8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4
```

Started StrongSwan:

```
sudo ipsec start --nofork --conf hello.conf
```

Started a DNS server that redirects the ePDG VPN server domain to my fake Wi-Fi calling server:

```
sudo dnsmasq -d --no-resolv --no-hosts --log-queries --server 8.8.8.8 --address=/epdg.epc.mnc260.mcc310.pub.3gppnetwork.org/192.168.1.10
```

Then I changed the DNS on my phone, activated Wi-Fi calling, and saw this on my console:

```
07[NET] received packet: from 192.168.1.9[40844] to 192.168.1.10[500] (496 bytes)

```

And there's my IMSI, sent to any adversary that controls a Wi-Fi network, a DNS, and a VPN server.
